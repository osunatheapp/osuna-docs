# RULES/Content Policy

1. Discussions are welcome but do not bully any specific posts or users. Osuna is a place for sharing thoughts and not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Osuna free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned. This includes but is not limited to abusing, harassing and threatening others.
2. Respect the privacy of others. Do not post or request personal or confidential information including phone numbers, street addresses, personally identifiable information, etc (aka ‘Doxing”). We have a zero tolerance policy on posting people’s private information.
3. If you’re posting lewd or sexually suggestive content, it is mandatory to enable the NSFW tag for such posts. Posts that are not tagged as such will be removed by moderators.
4. Osuna is a private and anonymous space to share your thoughts. However don’t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.
5. Do not post spam . Illegal Advertising (of all forms) is not encouraged ( this includes any type of referral linking, "offers", soliciting, begging, stream threads, etc ) except for advertisements placed by Osuna itself. 
6. The use of scrapers, bots, or other automated posting or downloading scripts is prohibited. If your posts continue getting reported, you will be suspended after review.
